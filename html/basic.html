                Nice is a wonderful place to visit as it is situated on the French Riverra, so you can get access to everything you need like stunning beaches,sensational bars, resturants, amazing views, and wonderful and interesting culture. <br>
                <br>
                Nice comes  with exceptional climate as well as its beauty. Nice is also a city of Arts and Culture after Paris, has the most museum in France. I will also like to taste their food like Socca, Salade Nicoise, Le Pan Bagnat, Pissaladiere(but not Pizza) and Ratatouilile.
