        <h2>Nice City, France</h2>

                Nice is a wonderful place to visit as it is situated on the French Riverra, so you can get access to everything you need like stunning beaches,sensational bars, resturants, amazing views, and wonderful and interesting culture. <br>
                <br>
                Nice comes  with exceptional climate as well as its beauty. Nice is also a city of Arts and Culture after Paris, has the most museum in France. I will also like to taste their food like Socca, Salade Nicoise, Le Pan Bagnat, Pissaladiere(but not Pizza) and Ratatouilile.

                Nice’s carnival is one of the biggest in the world and takes place every February. The first carnival was held in 1274 but it didn’t become official until the 19th century. There are lots of events held around town – cold water swims, waiter races and ‘flower battles’ where up to 100,000 flowers are thrown. Dressing up is encouraged and it’s great fun.
                <br>
                Socca is the local fast-food, made in copper pans over a very high heat. It’s made from chickpea flour, olive oil and water, which are poured into a flat pan and raked during cooking to make a crispy pancake. It’s the delicacy of the region and costs about €3 or €4. Head to Rene Socca or Lou Pilha Leva if you want to sit down, or Chez Theresa’s stall in the flower market (Cours Saleya) if you want to eat on the go. Try making it yourself afterwards too – chef Yotam Ottolenghi has a great recipe.
                <br>

Jazz arrived in Nice in the 1920s, along with American expats who made Nice their home. Many, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, hired big houses and threw wild parties, trying to forget the horrors of the First World War. There are lots of jazz clubs in Nice, an amazing jazz festival in July or you can visit the two places that are synonymous with the period – the Hotel Belles Rives, where Fitzgerald wrote or the Hotel du Cap, which he used as inspiration for his classic novel Tender is the Night.

        <h2>A Foreign Language(French)</h2>
        <p class="paras">In today’s world, speaking one foreign language is not enough. Students who speak several languages will increase their chances of finding a job, whether at home or abroad. Learning another language enriches the mind and opens up new horizons, both personal and professional.
